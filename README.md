# Hierarchical Sensory Predictive Control
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Code associated to the paper "The Perceptual Shaping of Anticipatory Actions" by Maffei G., Herreros I., Sanchez-Fibla M., Ruck M., Friston K., Verschure P. (2017)

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.1780


It allows to reproduce the key results of the simulations presented in section 2.1.


Dependencies
————————————
The code is in python 2.7.3 and it is cross-platform with minimal dependencies with external packages. The only required (free) packages are:
- numpy
- json
- matplotlib

In addition Jupiter notebook is required in order to run the interface to reproduce the figures.

A full distribution (Python Anaconda) including all the required packages can by downloaded by the Continuum web page: https://www.continuum.io/downloads


Running the code
————————————————
Once the required packages have been installed the interface can be open by running the following command in a terminal window within the source directory:
ipython notebook Perceptual_shaping_anticipatory_actions.ipynb

A new window in the default browser should open automatically and display the interface to run the simulation. Cells should be run in sequence.
For more information on the use of Jupyter notebook visit the page: 
http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Note that once started the simulations run in the background in non-verbose mode. Each simulation might require some time to be completed.
